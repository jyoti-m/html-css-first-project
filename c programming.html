It is a low programming level language close to machine language It is widely used in the software development field. It is a procedure and structure oriented language. It has the full support of various operating systems and hardware platforms. Many compilers are available for executing programs written in 'C'. A compiler compiles the source file and generates an object file. A linker links all the object files together and creates one executable file. It is highly portable.</p>

                         <p>  C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more. </p>
